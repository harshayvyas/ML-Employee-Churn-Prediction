# Employee Churn Prediction Project
This project is based on the DataCamp course "Human Resources Analytics: Predicting Employee Churn in Python." The dataset was sourced from the DataCamp server, and a preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data manipulation were conducted to ensure the data was suitable for various algorithms.

Key Achievements
Achieved an ROC/AUC score of over 95% using the DecisionTreeClassifier.
Insights and Important Features
While accuracy and ROC/AUC scores are significant metrics, the most critical insights from this analysis are the important features identified that can drive actionable strategies. The key features influencing employee churn include:
**Employee Satisfaction**
**Time Spent at the Company**
**Performance Evaluation**
Additionally, factors such as the number of projects and hours worked per month are important indicators to monitor. For instance, keeping employees engaged by assigning new projects and ensuring they are busy can contribute positively to employee retention.
